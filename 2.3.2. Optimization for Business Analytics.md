Management Science
Discipline that aids decision making via scientific approach to managerial problems that have quantitative factors

Diagnostic analytics
Use of data to understand trends; "Why did it happen?"

Optimization
Involved in prescriptive analytics. Minimize or maximize the results of an objective function by modifying variables and remaining within certain constraints.

Optimization Variables
Values that affect the output of the objective function

Objective Function
A function that calculates a value that must be minimized or maximized; the goal to optimize in an optimization problem

Constraint
A statement about an optimization problem's objective function and/or variables that must be met for a solution to be correct.

Linear Programming
An optimization situation where all constraints and the objective function are linear functions and all variables are continuous.*
	Why must they be continuous? What is meant by continuous in this context?

Linear Function Examples
3x + 5
3x1 + 5x2 + 7

Non-Linear Function Examples
4x^2 + 7
(2/x) - 1
2x1x2 + 4
(x1/x2) - 2

Non-Linear Programming
An optimization situation where all constraints and/or the objective function are non-linear functions (and all variables are continuous*)
	Why must they be continuous? What is meant by continuous in this context?



Mathematical programming

Descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive analytics
