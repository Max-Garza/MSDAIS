A clustering algorithm that starts by treating every data point as a unique group. Then, through distance metric calculations, they are iteratively grouped until one group remains.

One can identify the ideal number of clusters by looking at the longest vertical arm in the plotted dendrogram. Draw a horizontal line through it and see how many arms it crosses through. That is the ideal number of clusters.
