Seeing if the alternate or null hypothesis is correct

```R Commander
>> # Basic hypothesis testing; compare two means
>> ## Generate data as needed
>> "continuous distributions"
>> select distribution
>> "Sample from ... distribution"
>> input variables
>> # Run hypothesis testing
>> "Basic statistics"

>> relevant parameters
```

Reject null hypothesis if P-value is < alpha (confidence threshold)
Fail to reject null hypothesis if P-value is >= alpha
