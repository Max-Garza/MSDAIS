A regression model that creates a linear function that fits the middle of the given datapoints.

$$y = m_{1}x_{1} + m_{2}x_{2} ... + b$$
The *m* coefficients and *b* intercept are optimized by minimizing residuals

If performed via statistical modeling, one gets the following metrics:
- r2
- Adjusted r2
- F-statistic
- Coefficients
- P-values
- Confidence Intervals
