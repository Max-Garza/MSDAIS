A function that, when graphed, produces a line with a constant slope. If there are multiple variables included and thus no constant slope is produced, then check each variable and its coefficient separately. If all produce a line with a constant slope, then the function is linear.

Examples
- 3*x* + 5
- 3*x*$_{1}$ + 5*x*$_{2}$ + 7
