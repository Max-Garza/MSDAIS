A form of predictive analytics that works specifically with time-series data as an explanatory variable, analyzing the impact the passage of time has on a response variable and extrapolating that value into the future

Typically, the process involves:
- Resampling
- Time-series decomposition
- Selection of an appropriate forecasting model
- Train forecasting model with training data
- Validate forecasting results by predicting testing data and comparing regression metrics
- Predict future values using the forecasting model

Can be done via forecasting models or supervised machine learning models
