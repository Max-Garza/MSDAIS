A network optimization problem that aims to find the shortest (least costly) path that connects two nodes - the origin and the destination. This problem has a supply (and demand) of 1, and it has one supply and one demand node. All others are transshipment. Every arc has a value of either 1 or zero - present or not present. May have to use dummy nodes to correct the number of supply and demand nodes.
