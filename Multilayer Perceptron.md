A simple neural network consisting of a input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Model will send data through the network and generate inputs. Then, it will iterate this process over a number of epochs until hitting user limit or the model cannot improve.

If implementing regression, all data must be scaled between 0 and 1. If implementing classification, input variables must be scaled between 0 and 1.
