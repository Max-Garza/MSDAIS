The process of bringing observations into similar groups based on variable values, usually via a machine learning algorithm. Operates by calculating some distance metric between observations and achieving two targets:
* Minimize in-cluster distance
* Maximize out-cluster distance
Typically, variables must be standardized before applying a machine learning (clustering) model and must be quantitative
