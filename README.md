## FILE CONVENTIONS
A prefix containing a string of three numbers use each number to define an attribute about the file. The first number denotes the family, the second denotes the semester a class was taken, and the third helps alphabetize the files by course name within a semester.
* 1.X.X. Family - Final notes taken for a concept or class
  * 1.0.0. All Notes - A collection of notes across all classes
  * 1.1.1. Analytics - A collection of notes relevant to Analytics
  * 1.1.2. Computing for Data Analytics - A collection of notes relevant to Computing for Data Analytics
  * 1.1.3. Database Management Systems - A collection of notes relevant to Database Management Systems
  * 1.2.1. Data Warehousing - A collection of notes relevant to Data Warehousing
  * 1.2.2. Forecasting and Simulation - A collection of notes relevant to Forecasting and Simulation
  * 1.2.3. Machine Learning - A collection of notes relevant to Machine Learning
  * 1.3.1. Business Statistics - A collection of notes relevant to Business Statistics
  * 1.3.2. Optimization for Business Analytics - A collection of notes relevant to Optimization for Business Analytics
* 2.X.X. Family - Temporary notes taken during classes or private research
  * 2.3.1. Business Statistics - A collection of temporary notes taken during Business Statistics
  * 2.3.2. Optimization - A collection of temporary notes taken during Optimization for Business Analytics
 
Notes with prefixes are collections of smaller, conceptual notes. Conceptual notes have no prefix.

## HOW TO VIEW FILES
Files are best viewed in Obsidian.md as there are connections between notes and note embeddings that cannot be seen in other applications.

## OBSIDIAN.MD INTRODUCTION
Obsidian.md is a knowledge management application that allows one to link and embed .md files to and within one another.

Say that a student is taking two classes: Analytics (ANLY) and Database Management Systems (DBMS). One week, they learn about observations and datasets in DBMS and learn about datasets, samples, and populations in ANLY. Normally, the student would have entirely separate notes for these two classes - including for the concept of datasets. Though easy to manage, this leads to a lack of understanding of how these ideas connect. Further, the notes on datasets are completely separate, leading to segregated understandings of the concept.

If the student uses Obsidian.md, they can create separate notes for each concept taught in these classes and link them together. Links allow one to see connections between ideas, and breaking notes into concepts lets one combine knowledge gained about a concept from multiple classes. So, instead of having separate entries for "Dataset" in an ANLY notes file and a DBMS notes file, they can refer to a single note "Dataset" and add all knowledge into it.

One can reintroduce the structure of notes separated by class through embedding. Embedding allows one to see the contents of one note within another note, which lets us embed all concepts related to a class into a note dedicated to a class. Further, the concepts can be embedded in multiple class files, and updating the embedded note will update its contents across files.

The biggest advantages to Obsidian.md compared to traditional note-taking are that it allows one to see and form connections between ideas and to more easily consolidate their knowledge on a subject, regardless of where and when they learned something.

## OBSIDIAN.MD LINK STRUCTURE
All files in the 1.X.X. family have conceptual notes embedded within them. Meanwhile, files in the 2.X.X. family may contain links or embeds, but they are unimportant as they are temporary.

Conceptual notes link between one another. Typically, links are made to concepts that must be known to understand the note at hand. For instance, the concept "Butterfly Lifecycle" requires one to understand what a chrysalis is, so a link is made to "Chrysalis" within "Butterfly Life Cycle."
