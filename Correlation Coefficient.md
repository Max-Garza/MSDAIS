A metric denoting the strength and direction of a correlation.
$$r = \frac{\sum_{(x_{i} - \bar{x})(y_{i} - \bar{y})}^{}}{\sqrt{\sum_{(x_{i - \bar{x}})^2}^{}\sum_{(y_{i} - \bar{y})^2}^{}}}$$
*r* can fall between a range of 1 and -1. When the |*r*| is close to 1, the correlation is strong, and when it is close to zero, it is weak. If *r* is positive, the correlation is positive, and the correlation is negative when *r* is negative.
