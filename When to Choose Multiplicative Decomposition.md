Visually, one can choose multiplicative decomposition if the seasonality increases over time. Alternatively, perform both additive and multiplicative decomposition and compare the spread and value of residuals after standardization. The one with smaller spread/value is more appropriate.

Proper understanding of multiplicative vs additive natures of time-series data will lead to the selection of appropriate forecasting models
