Statistical modeling is similar to machine learning, especially supervised machine learning tasks, but there are some differing qualities:

Statistical Modeling
- Provides a robust statistical output
- Good on small sets of data
- Typically used to understand trends within a dataset, ie diagnostic analytics, instead of predicting values
- Models are typically easy to understand

Machine Learning
- Gives performance metrics but almost nothing else
- Good on large sets of data
- Typically used to predict values, ie predictive analytics, instead of understanding dataset trends
- Models are typically difficult to understand

Sometimes, people will begin with statistical modeling to understand a dataset and its structure well before moving towards machine learning solutions.
