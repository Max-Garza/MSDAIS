In linear programming, every problem has an equivalent formulation where the objective function is reversed. The problem we start with is known as the "primal" and the inverse is known as the "dual". Both problems provide the same answer, but they use relevant variables and equations in different ways.

To begin, let's learn how different problem components relate to one another in this duality:

| Primal Component               | Dual Component                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Constraint                     | Decision variable              |
| Decision variable              | Constraint                     |
| Objective function coefficient | RHS of constraint              |
| RHS of constraint              | Objective function coefficient |

Here's a direct mapping:
